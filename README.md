**0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O**

This repository contains code in C that illustrates some sorting algorithms
Examples of those algorithms are;
1. Bubble sort algorithm
2. Inserion sort algorithm
3. Selection sort algorithm
4. Quick sort algorithm
5. Merge sort algorithm
...

This project also covers the time conplexities of these sorting algorithms.
Time complexities are:
1. O(1)
2. O(n)
3. O(n!)
4. n square -> O(n^2)
5. log(n) -> O(log(n))
6. n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
7. n + k -> O(n+k)
...
